# 🌍 World Population Growth Analysis  

## 📌 Overview  
This project explores **global population growth trends** using Python in Jupyter Notebook.  
The analysis covers population size, yearly growth rates, and population density across years.  

Dataset: **World Population Growth.csv**  

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries  
- Python (Jupyter Notebook - Anaconda)  
- **pandas, numpy** → data cleaning & preprocessing  
- **matplotlib, seaborn** → data visualization  
- **GitHub** → version control & project showcase  

---

## ⚙️ Data Preprocessing  
- Removed commas and `%` symbols from numerical columns  
- Converted values to numeric datatypes (`int64`, `float`)  
- Checked for missing/null values  
- Ensured the dataset was clean for analysis

## 📊 Visualizations  
1. **World Population Growth Over Time**  
   Shows the steady rise in total population across years.

2. **Yearly Growth Rate (%)**  
   Highlights periods of high and low population growth.

3. **Population Density Over Time**  
   Shows how density has increased alongside population growth.

## 🔎 Key Insights  
- The dataset spans **[start year] to [end year]**.  
- Population grew from **[X billion in start year]** to **[Y billion in end year]**.  
- 📈 **Highest yearly growth rate:** [value]% in [year].  
- 📉 **Lowest yearly growth rate:** [value]% in [year].  
- 🌍 Despite a declining growth percentage, **absolute population continues to rise**, leading to higher density and resource pressure.

## 🚀 Future Work  
- Forecast future population growth using machine learning models  
- Analyze continent/region-level population trends  
- Explore links between population growth, urbanization, and environmental impact
